        </h2>
        <p>
            The National Electronic Approvals Tracking System (NEATS) has been developed as part of the reform process to
            establish a single national regulator for offshore petroleum activities in Commonwealth waters.
            NEATS is administrated by the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator, acting on behalf
            of the Australian Government.
